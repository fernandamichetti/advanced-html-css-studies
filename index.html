                The basics about HTML

            <h3>HyperText Markup Language</h3>
            <p>
                When we talk about HTML we’re talking about a Text Document.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="callout">&#128161; The tags <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and
                    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> are optional tags in HTML5. It's a common
                    practice cause it used to be mandatory and it ended becoming a stardard practice, but it's not
                    necessary.

                </span>
            </p>

            <h4>Markup</h4>
            <p>
                We use <strong>tags</strong> (start and end tag) to tell the computer what that line means.
                It’s a
                friendly user agent’s (and easy for
                humans to read) way to markup the document. You’re adding<strong> meaning</strong> to the
                document.
            </p>

            <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;h1&gt;My name is Fernanda&lt;/h1&gt; //you're saying to the computer that this is the MOST important part of the
                document
                        </code>
                        </pre>

            <h4>Language</h4>

            <p>
                We need a <strong>markup language</strong> because if we don’t have one each person will
                mark the
                document in a unique way, making it
                impossible for the user agent to know what each person means. That’s why it was created a
                language
                so we
                have a:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Consistent vocabulary</li>
                <li>Can convey meaning clearly</li>
                <li>Exists to facilitate communication</li>
                <li>When learning, can go to a dictionary and look it up</li>
            </ul>

                Basic elements structure that most HTML documents have
            </p>

            <h3>Metadata</h3>
            <p>
                The metadata in a HTML document should be inside the <strong>head</strong> element.
                <br>
                <span class="callout">
                    &#128161; The head element represents a collection of metadata for the Document

            <p>
                It can be a number of different metadata, but the most commom ones are:
            </p>

            <h4>Title</h4>
            <p>
                The title of the document must be explanatory in itself, because it can appear isolated or out
                of
                context, such as in a
                favorite bar, history or google search.

                <span class="callout">

                    taken out of context
                </span>
            </p>

            <h4>Charset</h4>
            <p>
                A standard way to start a HTML Document is having the charset and the title defined.

            <h4>Content</h4>
            <p>
                The body element comes after the head element and it’ll have all the content of the

            <h3>Self-Contained Composition</h3>

            <h4>The <strong>Article</strong> Element</h4>
            <p>
                The Article Element represents a <strong>complete, or self-contained, composition</strong> in a
                document, page, application, or site and that’s, in principle,independently distributable or
                reusable
                (you can take that element to another place (another site, etc) and it will still make sense in
                itself).
                <strong>It’s self-contained</strong>
            </p>
            <p>It falls into 3 main categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is a flow element - essentially the document flowing from top to bottom</li>
                <li>Is a sectioning element - Is a content that defines the scope of the outline, potentially
                    has a
                    heading and a outline.</li>
                <li>Is a palpable content - It’s expected, generally, that there’s something inside the element.
                    There’ll be other elements
                    inside of it.</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="callout">
                &#128161; Inside the article element it can have any kind of flow content
            </span>

            <h4>The <strong>Section</strong> Element</h4>
            <h5>Thematic Grouping</h5>
            <p>Represents a generic section of a document. In this context, is a thematic grouping of
                content,
                typically
                with a heading
                <br>
                Everything inside the element <strong>section</strong> must be intertwined, connected.
            </p>

            <h4>The Aside Element - Tangential Content</h4>

            <p>
                Represents a section of a page that consists of content that's <strong>tangentially
                    related</strong> to
                the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that
                content. Such
                sections are often represented as sidebars in printed typography.
                <br>
                <span class="callout">
                    &#128161; It's important to <strong>NOT</strong> think about the aside element as something
                    visual.
                    When
                    you're
                    authoring a HTML document you must do it in a future proof way, as in you don't know if one
                    day this
                    document will be read out load or printed, so the tags must be placed as a way to markup
                    something,
                    regardless of where it will appear in the page.
                </span>
            </p>

            <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;p&gt;
                        My name is Fernanda and I'm learning how to author a HTML Document. <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>I have two dogs, named Lupin and
                        Jager&lt;/aside&gt;
                        &lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <p>
                <span class="callout">&#128161;
                    The way that we know that it's allowed to have a article or section element inside a
                    section element
                    is
                    through the documentation. When we look at the specification of those elements, we see
                    that the
                    content
                    model says that it supports flow content and a aside element is a flow content.
                    Therefore, this is
                    legal/allowed!
                </span>
            </p>


            <h3>Heading and Rank</h3>
            <p>
                Its content model is <strong>Phrasing</strong>, so it's different from the elements seen above.
                It
                means you can't put a flow element (as aside, article, section etc) inside it.
                <br>
                These elements have a <strong>rank</strong> given by the number in their name. The
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element has the highest rank, while the <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> element
                has
                the
                lowest rank.
                <br>
                <span class="callout">
                    &#128161; When you have two heading of equal or higher rank, it's implied you're starting a new
                    section
                    and when you have a heading of lower rank it's implied that this new heading is a subsection of
                    the
                    previous one
                </span>
            </p>
            <h3>Headers and Footers</h3>
            <p>
                Its content model is flow content, but with no header or footer
            </p>
            <h4>Header</h4>
            <p>
                The <strong>header</strong> element is intended to usually contain the section's heading,
                but it's
                not required. It can also be used to wrap a section's table of contents, a search form, or
                any
                relevant logs.
            </p>
            <h4>Footer</h4>
            <p>
                The <strong>footer</strong> element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning
                content
                or
                sectioning root element. Tipically contains information about its section such as who wrote
                it,
                links,
                copyright data and the like.

            <h3>The Address element</h3>
            <p>

                About HTML elements that have to do with grouping things
            </p>


            <h3>Paragraph</h3>
            <p>
                A paragraph, represented by the tag <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is typically a run of phrasing content
                that
                forms a block of text with one or more <strong>sentences that discuss a particular topic</strong>,
                bun
                can also be used for more <strong>general thematic grouping</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <p>A quote, represented by the tag <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> represents a section that is quoted
                from
                another source and the address to that source may be cited in the
                <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>atribute.
                <br>
                Example:
            </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element">
                <p>
                    Attribution for the quotation, if any, must be placed outside the blockquote element.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> - HTML Spec</p>

            <p>
                <span class="callout">&#128161;The &lt;blockquote&gt; should be used when you want to cite a long
                    phrase,
                    instead the &lt;q&gt; tag should be used for inline quotations.</span>
            </p>

            <h3>Unordened Lists</h3>
            <p>
                A unordened list, represented by the tag <code>&lt;ul&gt;, represents a list of items, where the order is not important.
                    <br>
                        The itens inside the list will be represented by the tag <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.
                </code>
                <br>
                <span class="callout">
                    &#128161; An <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element's end tag can be <strong>omitted</strong> if the
                    <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element is followed by another one or if there's no more content in the
                    parent
                    element
                </span>
            </p>

            <h3>Ordened Lists</h3>
            <p>
                An ordened list, represented by the tag <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> represents a list of items where the
                items have been intentionally ordered, which means that changing the order would change the meaning
                of
                the document.
                <br>
                <span class="callout">
                    &#128161; The <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tag supports a attribute called <strong>reversed</strong>.
                    If
                    present, it
                    indicates that the list is descending (3, 2, 1..), if not, the list is ascending (1, 2,
                    3...)<br>
                    Another attribute is the <strong>start</strong> that you can define in which number the list
                    will
                    start.
                </span>
            </p>

            <h3>Association Lists</h3>
            <p>
                An association list, represented by the tag <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> consists of zero or more
                name(<code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>)-value(<code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>) groups.
                <br>
                It can be terms and definitions, metadata topics and values, questions and answers or any other
                groups
                of name-value data.
            </p>

            <h4>dl</h4>
            <p>Open and closes a association list</p>
            <h4>dt</h4>
            <p>Representes the term or nome, part of a term-description group<br>When used inside a
                <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> tag, the <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> itself doesn't indicate that its
                content are a term being
                defined, for that you must use the <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> tag.
            </p>
            <h4>dd</h4>
            <p>Represents the description, definition or value, part of a term-description group in a
                description
                list
                (<code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>)</p>

            <p>Example:
            <pre>
                                    <code>
                                        &lt;dl&gt;

                            </code>
                            </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="callout">&#128161; Even though the closing tag for<code> &lt;dd&gt;</code> and
                    <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> are optional if the imeddiately following tag is another dd or dt, it's
                    a
                    good practice to
                    use it, because
                    <q cite="https://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/lists/dd.html">its use prevents common

                <span class="callout">&#128161; The tag <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> are not allowed inside a

            <h3>Multidimensional Content - Tabular Data</h3>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element/tag represents data with more than one dimension, in the
                form
                of a <strong>table</strong>.
                <br>
                It has rows, columns and cells given by their descendants. The rows and columns form a
                <strong>grid</strong>; a table's cells must completely cover that grid without overlap
            </p>

            <h4>Elements correleated/related with Table:</h4>

            <h5>Caption Element</h5>
            <p>Represents the title of the table and can explain what it's for or how to use it
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="callout">&#128161; When the table is the only content in a figure element, the
                    <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>should be used in favor of the <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code>
                    element
                </span>
            </p>

            <h5>Colgroup Tag</h5>

            <p>This element serves as a container for <code>&lt;col&gt;</code> elements and it's used to
                style
                one or more columns for all table rows
                <br>
                It can have zero, one, or more
                <code>&lt;col&gt;</code> elements
            </p>

            <h6>Col Tag</h6>
            <p>Is used to represent one or more columns in the column group.
                <br><br>
                Example:
            </p>

            <pre>
                        <code>
                            &lt;table&gt;

            <h5>th tag</h5>
            <p>
                Represents a header cell in a table; per default it has bold lettering.
                <br>
                It has five attributes:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Colspan</strong> - Number of columns that the cell is to span</li>
                <li><strong>Rowspan</strong> - Number of rows that the cell is to span</li>
                <li><strong>Headers</strong> - Specify the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> tag each
                    <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tag is related to
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scope</strong> - Specifies which cells the header cell applies to.
                    <br>
                    There's four
                    states:
                    <ul>
                        <li>row - applies to subsequent cells in the same row</li>
                        <li>col - applies to subsequent cells in the same column</li>
                        <li>rowgroup - applies to a group of rows</li>
                        <li>colgroup - applies to a group of columns</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <span class="callout">&#128161; No visual effect, but good for screen readers!</span>

            <h2>Section 6: Text itself</h2>
            <p>About changing the meaning of the document, but at an text level.
                <br>
                <span>
                    <strong>HTML tags/elements must not be used thinking visually, it's always about the
                        meaning</strong>.
                </span>
            </p>

            <h3>Emphasis - <code>&lt;em&gt;</code></h3>
            <p>For emphasazing something in the text, the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag is the most apropriate. The
                easiest way to know when it's appropriete to use <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is to think how you would say
                the phrase.
                <br>
                <span class="callout">&#128161; It <em>must</em> not be used as a way to make the text "italic". This
                    tag, as well as the others seen bellow must be used thinking about the meaning of the document and
                    not how it will be viewed. It's also not a tag that convey importance, for that the
                    <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> is the right element.
                </span>
                <br>
                In the past it was normal to use the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag when
                you wanted to make something italic, these days the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> should be used when you
                want to represent a alternate voice, mood or otherwise offset from the normal prose, like indicating
                a different quality of text as a cientific name, technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another
                language etc.
            </p>

            <h3>Importance - <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></h3>
            <p>
                When you have something in the text that should be represented as something of strong importance,
                seriousness or urgency.
                <br>
                Even though by default most user agents make the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag appear with a bold
                effect, it's important to not use the element for this purpose.
            </p>

            <h3>Side Comments - <code>&lt;side&gt;</code></h3>
            <p>
                It's a tag used to represent side comments such as small print, disclaimers, coyrights.
                <br>
                It should not be used for extented texts, but for short ones and also not be used for subheadings.
            </p>

            <h3>Line Breaks - br</h3>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag must be used only in line breaks that are <strong>actually</strong> part
                of the content, not to separating thematic groups in a paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>1. Wrong use of the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;label&gt;Name: Fernanda&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;label&gt;Age: 26&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>

            <code>
                <p>
                    Name: Fernanda
                    <br>
                    Age: 26
                </p>
            </code>

            <p>2. Right use to use <code>&lt;br&gt</code> tag:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
&lt;p&gt;
Name: Fernanda
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Age: 26
&lt;/p&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>

            <code>
                <p>
                    Name: Fernanda
                </p>
                <p>
                    Age: 26
                </p>
            </code>

            <h3>Author's Comments</h3>
            <p>
                When you want to make a comment or explain the code to yourself or to other future authors you should
                use &lt;!-- coment --&gt; that way the User Agent will know that this part should not be read.
            </p>

            <h3>Span</h3>
            <p>
                Is a meaningless element, but can be useful when used together with the global attributel like
                <code>class</code>, <code>lang</code> or <code>dir</code>

                <li><strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> - A set of rules for how two entities (client and

            <p>The HTML author will put the document in the server, then someone using a user agent (like a brownser)
                will request that HTML document (write the address of the site) and the server will deliver it. At that
                point the user agent will interpret that hypertext and deliver it to the user
                <br>
                That's why when you write a web address in the front there's "HTTP" or "HTTPS", cause that's the type of
                protocol you're using to see the site
                <br>
                Nowdays, besides Hypertext we send Hypermedia too though the HTTP

            <h3>Anchor Tags and Hypertext - a</h3>
            <p>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
                <br>
                When used, the attribute <strong>href</strong> indicates the link's destination.
                <br>
                There's a few other attributes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>download</strong> - when the link is clicked the target will be downloaded
                </li>
                <li><strong>hreflang</strong> - specificies the language of the link</li>
                <li>target - defines how the link will be open.
                    <ul>
                        <li>_blank</li> - opens in new link or tab
                        <li>-parent</li> - opens in the same frame as it was clicked
                        <li>_self</li> - opens in the parent frame
                        <li>_top</li> - opens in the full body of the window
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Besides tags, there's attributes that can be used as an anchor in your HTML, like <strong>id</strong>.
                <br>
                ID is a global attribut that must be unique in the element's tree and must contain at last one
                character. It's a unique identifier to a fragment of the code. When you give a id to a tag, you can get
                to them by URL using the url with #(the standard for indentifying a fragment) and the id.
                <br>
                Example:

            <h3>Object</h3>
            <p>
                A collection of data (information) and code (that accomplishes things) which together represents
                something
            </p>

            <h3>Model</h3>
            <p>A representation of a thing</p>

            <h3>Object Model</h3>
            <p>A collection of objects that represent a thing and provide access to examine and change that thing</p>

            <h3>The Document Object Model - DOM</h3>
            <p>
                An object model that represents an HTML document, providing the ability to examine and change the
                document as presented via the user agent
                <br>
                <span class="callout">&#128161; When you open the DevTools, the "Elements" tab is not showing the HTML,
                    but something that looks like the HTML to make it easier for the developers to visualize, but the
                    <strong>DOM</strong>.
                    The HTML itself will be shown in the network > response tab.</span>
                <br>
                The <strong>HTML document</strong> is downloaded by the User Agent who then creates the DOM based on the
                HTML that then is used to generate the visual representation of the HTML, which is the web page
                delivered to the user.

            <h3>Screen Reader</h3>
            <p>
                A screen reader is also a user agent, like a browser. But instead of traslating the data to a visual
                interface, the screen reader translates it to a non-visual way, through speech or braille.
            </p>

                Semantic and Accessibility
            </h3>
            <p>Using the right tags help the user agent screen reader to translate the data in the best way possible.
                For example, it can read a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag in a different volume or a slower voice, it can
                also be used to quickly navigate the document using keys for "jump to next heading" or "previous
                heading".</p>

            <h2>Section 9: Interactivy</h2>

            <h3>Nav Element</h3>
            <p>Represents a section of the page that links to other pages or parts within the page. It's not supposed to
                be used to any group of links, but for sections that consist of major navigation blocks.</p>

            <h3>Forms, Fields and Labels</h3>
            <p>The form element represents a hyperlink that can be manipulated and you can't have a form within a form
            </p>

            <p>Field (or control) ah HTML element that allows the user to input information. The values entered into
                these fields are then used to generate the query string "q=html&page=3&color=red"</p>
            <p>When a input field has the name "name" for example, the user agent is able to identify it and when the
                user click on the input field it will likely auto complete with the name of the user (if they have used
                this kind of input field before. If you don't want the auto complete feature to work just use
                autocomplete="off". This all means that when you choose the name of your data field/form field it can
                hve an impact on the user experience.</p>

            <p>The Label element is used to represent a caption in a user interface, when associated witha specific form
                control (input). When the user clicks on the label it will highlight the input/form control, the same
                way as if the input itself was clicked, except when the user clicks on the label the autocomplete mode
                won't show.
                <br>
                The label can be used in two different ways:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Implicit:</strong> Puting the input element <strong>inside</strong> the label element.</li>
                <li><strong>Explicit:</strong> Puting the input element <strong>outside</strong> the label element, this
                    way you have to give your
                    input an ID and use the attribute for in the label element, so you can say which ID/input that label
                    represents</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="callout">&#128161; For accessibility context the <strong>Explicit</strong> way is better,
                    because even though all screen reader should work with implicit label/input, some just won't play
                    nice with it.</span>

            </form>

            <p>The right way to separate different label/input in a form is using the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, as the
                specification says.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="callout">&#128161; The label has nothing to do with the <strong>query string</strong>, its
                    use
                    is purely for the user. The name/value pair is coming from the name attribute inside the input
                    element. So
                    it's the name attribute that is for the manipulation of the hyperlink.</span>
            </p>
            <p>Another attribute of the form tag is "method", by default the method is defined GET, but you can change
                it to POST and a few other that are not so used.</p>

            <h4>Diference GET and POST</h4>
            <h5>GET</h5>
            <p>Used to request data from a specified resource. The query string (name/value pairs) appears in the URL of
                the site.
                <br>
                It's only used to request data, not modify it and the data must be string type; It can be cached and
                remains in the browser history, besides that it can be bookmarked and have a lenght restriction (2048
                characters).
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="callout"> &#128161; It never should be used when dealing with sensitive data, because the
                    that is visible for <strong>everyone</strong> in the URL!</span>
            </p>

            <h5>POST</h5>
            <p>Used to send data to a server to create/update a resource, supports different data types. The data sent
                via POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request.
                <br>
                It can't be cached and don't reamin in the browser history, besides that it can't be bookmarked and
                don't have a lenght restriction.

            <p>You can create a button with a input that has a button type, but it's not de best way to use it.
                <br>
                HTML5 has a special tag called <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>. It has 3 attributes that define the type:
            <ul>
                <li>Subit: Submits the form</li>
                <li>Reset: Clears/resets the form</li>
                <li>Button: Does nothing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Section 10: Stylesheets and Querying Trees</h2>

            <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            <p>It's important to remember that when it comes to CSS, a rule that you apply to an element will not
                necessarily only apply to that said element, but sometimes it'll apply to its descendants too.</p>

            <h3>Universal Selector</h3>
            <p>Represented by <code>*</code>, it selects every element in the tree.
            </p>

            <h3>Attribute selectors</h3>
            <p>When you want to style a attribute. For that we put the name of the attribute inside [ ]. It can be used
                in different forms:
            <ul>
                <li>[name of attribute]: Every element that has an attribute will be given the style</li>
                <p>
                    <span class="callout"> &#128161; It's important to remember that usually the
                        <code>&lt;HTML&gt;</code> contains the attribute lang to define in which language the page is
                        written and every descendant of element of <p>&lt;HTML&gt;</p> will inherite its styles
                        <br>
                        Class, ID and slots are also attributes</span>
                </p>
                <li>[name of attribute=name of value]: Will only style the attribute whose value is axactly the name
                    given. Example: [lang=pt-br]
                </li>
                <li>[name of attribute~=name of value]: Will style attributes that have more than one word in which one
                    is exactly the name given</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Id selectors</h3>
            <p>When you want to style an specific ID you can use #nameOfID to set the rules of the style</p>

            <h3>Class selectors</h3>
            <p>To style an specific class you can use .nameOfClass. When you want to select of an specific element with
                that said class you can use element.nameOfClass. Example: div.names and even more than one class
                div.names.age that way if you have an element with the class name but not age the specified style won't
                be applied to that element</p>

            <h3>Group of selectors</h3>
            <p>When you want to give a rule of styles to more than one element you can use a comma to separate them.
                Example: ol, ul or even ol[lang], ul.name </p>
            <p>
                <span class="callout">&#128161; When using this to group elements it's important to garantee that
                    everything is corect, because if there's something that doens't exist in the document even those who
                    are correct won't have the style applied. For example, if you write incorrectly the class
                    name</span>
            </p>

            <h3>Descendants, Ancestors, Parents, Children and Sibilings</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Descendant:</strong> Refers to any element that is connected but <strong>lower</strong> down
                    the document tree - no matter how many levels</li>
                <li><strong>Ancestor:</strong> Refers to any element that is connected but <strong>further
                        up</strong>the document tree - no matter how many levels</li>
                <li><strong>Parent:</strong>Refers to an elements <strong>directly above and connected</strong> to an
                    element.</li>
                <li><strong>Child:</strong>Refers to an elements <strong>directly below and conected</strong> to an
                    element</li>
                <li><strong>Sibiling:</strong>Refers to an elements that <strong>shares the same parent</strong> to
                    another element</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Combinators: Descendant</h3>
            <p>Made up of <strong>two or more selectors separated by white space</strong> and selects elements B that
                are descendants from the element A.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example:
                <code>
        <pre>
            h1 strong { color: red;}

            &lt;h1&gt; This headline is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; importante&lt;h1&gt;
        </pre>
    </code>
                <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="callout">&#128161; When we say <strong>descendant of</strong> we're looking for
                    <strong>any</strong> ancestor, not just the immediate parent </span>
            </p>

            <h3>Combinators: Child</h3>
            <p class="test">When you want to select the directly below element of another you use &gt;</p>

            <p>Example:
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        h3 > p {
                            font-size: 20px;
                        }

                        div ol>li p {
                            font-size: 10px;
                        }
                    </pre>
                </code>
            </p>

            <h3>Combinators: Next-Sibiling</h3>
            <p>You can select the<strong> next</strong> sibiling of a element using +. </p>
            <p>Example:

                <code>
                    <pre>
                        ul + p {
                            font-size: 20px;
                        }
                    </pre>
                </code>
            </p>

            <h3>Combinators: Subsequent-Sibiling</h3>
            <p>
            <p>Different from the next-sibiling combinator, this one selects sibiling elements no matter if it's
                directly or no, it just have to come <strong>after</strong>. To select this you have to use a ~</p>

            <p>
                Example:
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        p ~ ol
                    </pre>
                </code>
            </p>

            <h3>Pseudo-class</h3>
            <p>Selection based on information that lies outside the document tree - It means that instead of the author
                saying directly which element should be styled, the selector asks the browserto look at the document
                tree and the select document comes from that analysis</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#pseudo-classes%E2%91%A0">
                <p>

            <h4>Child-index pseudo-classes</h4>
            <p>Selects elements based on their index amongst their inclusive siblings</p>

            <h5>:nth-child(An+B)</h5>
            <p>The sintax is element:nth-child(An-B) which means you take the results for the element, divides them into

                    Just the <strong>Second line</strong> will be red, because the first element of the first group is
                    the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> element.

                color red, just the second li will have it, because in the second group there's just one element, or li.

            <p>Since even and odd are so commonly instead of creating a mathematic rule you can just type even/odd for

            <p>It's also possible to just choose to apply a style to the first x elements with:</p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    <pre>

                    <pre>

                </code>
            </p>
            <p>It's possible to also choose a range of elements, from the x to the y the style must be applied:</p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    <pre>

            <h5>:nth-last-child(An+B)</h5>
            <p>
                This pseudo-class matches elements based on their position <strong>among</strong> a group of sibilings,
                counting <strong>from the end</strong>
            </p>

            <h4>Type Child-Indexed Pseudo-classes</h4>
            <p>They work based on an element's indeix among elements of the <strong>same type</strong> in their sibiling
                list. So while the child-index looks for something around all the sibilings of a parent, no matter it's
                type, the type child-index looks the index of only the same tag of a sibling list.</p>

            <h5>:nth-of-type(An+B)</h5>
            <p>It does the same type as the nth-child, but only between those with the same tag inside a parent element.
            </p>

            <h4>Location Pseudo-Classes</h4>
            <p>This kind of pseudo classes lets you make selections based on links, it's status or where it may be going
                to.
                <br>
                The two most common (and mutually exclusive) are:
            <ul>
                <li>:link - Apply to links that have not yet been visited</li>
                <li>:visited - Apply to those who have been visited by the user</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>User Action Pseudo-Classes</h4>
            <p>This pseudo-classes selects something based on a action that the user did.
                <br>
                The common are:
            <ul>
                <li>:hover or :focus - When the cursor hovers over a element or an elements hs the focus (using keyboard
                    or mouse events)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Negation (Matches None) Pseudo-Class</h4>
            <p>Finds elements that are <strong>not</strong> something</p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        section:not(#section1) {
                            font-style: italic;
                        }
                    </pre>
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>It will style all the sections, except the section with the ID section1 with a italic style</p>

            <h3>Pseudo-elements</h3>
            <p>Basically elements in the document that haven't been marked up as elements. For example there's the
                pseudo-elements "first-letter", there isn't a tag that says it, but you can style it.
                <br>
                Example:
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        p::first-letter {
                            font-weight: bold;
                        }
                    </pre>
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>To "find" a pseudo-elements you always use double : </p>

            <h3>The Cascade</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="callout">The Cascade means that after the declarations have been sorted (put in the right
                    order), the one that will be applied is the top one and the bellow will be ignored.</span>
                <br>
                This order takes into consideration:
            <ol>
                <li>Origin</li>
                <li>Importance</li>
                <li>Specificity</li>
                <li>Order of Appareance</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h4>Origin</h4>
            <p>Besides the multiple stylesheet that the author can create, the user agent also have its own stylesheet.
                <br>
                Talking about the <strong>origin</strong> of the declarations, the <strong>author</strong> declaration
                will always be prioritize over the user agent declaration <strong>(if the user declaration is not marked
                    up as important</strong>)
                <br>

            <h4>Importance</h4>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Important user agent declarations</li>
                <li>Important author declarations</li>
                <li>Normal author declarations</li>
                <li>Normal user declarations</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            If the <strong>user agent</strong> marks something as important there's nothing the author can do.
            <br>
            The way that you can mark something as important is putting "!important" after the declarations.
            <br>
            Like this:
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        h2 {
                            font-weight: bold !important;
                        }
                    </pre>
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="callout">The important mark up <strong>must</strong> only be used in specific
                    cenarios.</span>
            </p>

            <h4>Specificity</h4>
            <p>Each selector has a specificity number, that's defined by:
            <ol>
                <li>Number of ID selectors in the selector</li>
                <li>Number of class, attributes and pseudo-classes in the selector</li>
                <li>Number of type selectors and pseudo-elements in the selector</li>
                <li>Ignore the universal selector</li>
            </ol>
            To discover the specifity number you have to count the 3 first options.
            <br>
            Example:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    #skills   100 (has one ID (1), there isn't any class, attribute or pseudo class (0) and there isn't any type selector or pseudo-element (0));

                    #skills .resume-list 110 (has one ID (1), one class (1) and there isn't any type selector (0));

                    .skills 010 (there isn't ID (0), has a class (1) e there isn't any type or pseudo-element (0));

                    section.skills 011 (there's no ID (0), has one class (1) and one type selector (1))
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>The higher number the higher the specificity;</p>

            <h4>Order of appearance</h4>
