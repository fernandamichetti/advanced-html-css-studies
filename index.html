                &#128161; Data structure - a particular way to organize and store data so that computer
                can
                quickly and
                efficiently access
                and modify it.
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s different kinds of data structures, each being usefull to different purposes.
                For <b>html and css</b> the most important kind of data structure is the one called <b>trees</b>.

                The basics about HTML
            </p>
            <h3>HyperText Markup Language</h3>
            <p>
                When we talk about HTML we’re talking about a Text Document.
            </p>
            <p class="callout">&#128161; The tags <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and
                <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> are optional tags in HTML5. It's a common
                practice cause it used to be mandatory and it ended becoming a stardard practice, but it's not
                necessary.

                User agent - Software that acts on the user’s behalf
            </p>

            <h4>Markup</h4>
            <p>
                We use <strong>tags</strong> (start and end tag) to tell the computer what that line means. It’s a
                friendly user agent’s (and easy for
                humans to read) way to markup the document. You’re adding<strong> meaning</strong> to the document.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    &lt;h1&gt;My name is Fernanda&lt;/h1&gt; //you're saying to the computer that this is the MOST important part of the
            document
        </code>
        </pre>

            <h4>Language</h4>
            <p>
                We need a <strong>markup language</strong> because if we don’t have one each person will mark the
                document in a unique way, making it
                impossible for the user agent to know what each person means. That’s why it was created a language so we
                have a:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consistent vocabulary</li>
                <li>Can convey meaning clearly</li>
                <li>Exists to facilitate communication</li>
                <li>When learning, can go to a dictionary and look it up</li>

                Basic elements structure that most HTML documents have
            </p>
            <h3>Metadata</h3>
            <p>
                The metadata in a HTML document should be inside the <strong>head</strong> element.
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
                &#128161; The head element represents a collection of metadata for the Document
            </p>
            <p>
                It can be a number of different metadata, but the most commom ones are:
            </p>
            <h4>Title</h4>
            <p>
                The title of the document must be explanatory in itself, because it can appear isolated or out of
                context, such as in a
                favorite bar, history or google search.
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
                &#128161; Should be different from its first heading, since the h1 doest not have to stand alone when
                taken out of context
            </p>

            <h4>Charset</h4>
            <p>
                A standard way to start a HTML Document is having the charset and the title defined.

            <h4>Content</h4>
            <p>
                The body element comes after the head element and it’ll have all the content of the document, everything

            <h3>Self-Contained Composition</h3>
            <h4>The <strong>Article</strong> Element</h4>
            <p>
                The Article Element represents a <strong>complete, or self-contained, composition</strong> in a
                document, page, application, or site and that’s, in principle,independently distributable or reusable
                (you can take that element to another place (another site, etc) and it will still make sense in itself).
                <strong>It’s self-contained</strong>
            </p>
            <p>It falls into 3 main categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Is a flow element - essentially the document flowing from top to bottom</li>
                <li>Is a sectioning element - Is a content that defines the scope of the outline, potentially has a
                    heading and a outline.</li>
                <li>Is a palpable content - It’s expected, generally, that there’s something inside the element.
                    There’ll be other elements
                    inside of it.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="callout">
                &#128161; Inside the article element it can have any kind of flow content
            </p>

            <h4>The <strong>Section</strong> Element</h4>
            <h5>Thematic Grouping</h5>
            <p>Represents a generic section of a document. In this context, is a thematic grouping of content, typically
                with a heading
                <br>
                Everything inside the element <strong>section</strong> must be intertwined, connected.
            </p>

            <h4>The Aside Element</h4>
            <h5>Tangential Content</h5>
            <p>
                Represents a section of a page that consists of content that is <strong>tangentially related</strong> to
                the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content. Such
                sections are often represented as sidebars in printed typography.
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
                &#128161; It's important to <strong>NOT</strong> think about the aside element as something visual. When
                you're
                authoring a HTML document you must do it in a future proof way, as in you don't know if one day this
                document will be read out load or printed, so the tags must be placed as a way to markup something,
                regardless of where it will appear in the page.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    &lt;p&gt;
                    My name is Fernanda and I'm learning how to author a HTML Document. <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>I have two dogs, named Lupin and
                    Jager&lt;/aside&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p class="callout">
                The way that we know that it's allowed to have a article or section element inside a section element is
                through the documentation. When we look at the specification of those elements, we see that the content
                model says that it supports flow content and a aside element is a flow content. Therefore, this is
                legal/allowed!
            </p>

            <h3>Heading and Rank</h3>
            <p>
                Its content model is <strong>Phrasing</strong>, so it's different from the elements seen above. It
                means you can't put a flow element (as aside, article, section etc) inside it.
                <br>
                These elements have a <strong>rank</strong> given by the number in their name. The
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element has the highest rank, while the <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> element has the
                lowest rank.
            </p>

            <p class="callout">
                &#128161; When you have two heading of equal or higher rank, it's implied you're starting a new section
                and when you have a heading of lower rank it's implied that this new heading is a subsection of the
                previous one
            </p>

            <h3>Headers and Footers</h3>
            <p>
                Its content model is flow content, but with no header or footer
            </p>

            <h4>Header</h4>
            <p>
                The <strong>header</strong> element is intended to usually contain the section's heading, but it's
                not required. It can also be used to wrap a section's table of contents, a search form, or any
                relevant logs.
            </p>

            <h4>Footer</h4>
            <p>
                The <strong>footer</strong> element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or
                sectioning root element. Tipically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links,
                copyright data and the like.
            </p>

            <h3>The Address element</h3>
            <p>
                Represents the contact information for its nearest article or body <strong>ancestor</strong> - not
                sibilings. It <strong>must not</strong> be used to represent arbitrary addresses, unless those addresses
                are in fact relevant contact information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Its content model is also flow content, but with no heading content descendants, no sectioning content
                descendants and no <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> or
                <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> element descendants</code>
            </p>

            <p class="subsection">
                About HTML elements that have to do with grouping things
            </p>

            <h3>Paragraph</h3>
            <p>
                A paragraph, represented by the tag <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is typically a run of phrasing content that
                forms a block of text with one or more <strong>sentences that discuss a particular topic</strong>, bun
                can also be used for more <strong>general thematic grouping</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <p>A quote, represented by the tag <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> represents a section that is quoted from
                another source and the address to that source may be cited in the <code>&lt;cite&gt; atribute</code><br>
                Example:
            </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element">
                <p>
                    Attribution for the quotation, if any, must be placed outside the blockquote element.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> - HTML Spec</p>

            <p class="callout">&#128161;The &lt;blockquote&gt; should be used when you want to cite a long phrase,
                instead the &lt;q&gt; tag should be used for inline quotations.</p>

            <h3>Unordened Lists</h3>
            <p>
                A unordened list, represented by the tag <code>&lt;ul&gt;, represents a list of items, where the order is not important.
                <br>
                    The itens inside the list will be represented by the tag <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.
                </code>
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
                &#128161; An <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element's end tag can be <strong>omitted</strong> if the
                <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element is followed by another one or if there's no more content in the parent
                element
            </p>

            <h3>Ordened Lists</h3>
            <p>
                An ordened list, represented by the tag <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> represents a list of items where the
                items have been intentionally ordered, which means that changing the order would change the meaning of
                the document.
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
                &#128161; The <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tag supports a attribute called <strong>reversed</strong>. If
                present, it
                indicates that the list is descending (3, 2, 1..), if not, the list is ascending (1, 2, 3...)<br>
                Another attribute is the <strong>start</strong> that you can define in which number the list will start.
            </p>

            <h3>Association Lists</h3>
            <p>
                An association list, represented by the tag <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> consists of zero or more
                name(<code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>)-value(<code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>) groups.
                <br>
                It can be terms and definitions, metadata topics and values, questions and answers or any other groups
                of name-value data.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h4>dl</h4>
                <p>Open and closes a association list</p>
                <h4>dt</h4>
                <p>Representes the term or nome, part of a term-description group<br>When used inside a
                    <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> tag, the <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> itself doesn't indicate that its
